  Shanghai Electronic Certification Authority Co., Ltd.

- **Incident description:**

  SHECA received an email notifying us that there were problems with the OCSP responses of the following two certificates. After investigation, it was found that the certificate information was not written into the database due to a bug in the code, resulting in abnormal OCSP responses.

### Impact

- **Total number of certificates:** Two certificates were found to be affected by this incident.
- **Total number of "remaining valid" certificates:** Over 23000 certificates remain valid.
- **Affected certificate types:** DV SSL certificates, OV SSL certificates, EV SSL certificates
- **Incident heuristic:** When writing certificate data, attention should be paid to the use of database transactions to prevent abnormal certificate status due to improper transaction management.
- **Was issuance stopped in response to this incident, and why or why not?** The issuance has not been stopped. Because the CRLs of the relevant certificates are normal, SHECA is restoring the data of the three certificates through code to repair the OCSP responses of the three certificates.
- **Analysis:** N/A
- **Additional considerations:** There was no alert mechanism in place for network exceptions during service invocation.

### Timeline

**All timestamps are Beijing time (UTC+8)**

- **2025-05-07 09:09:00** The Compliance Department received a notification that the OCSP responses of two certificates were abnormal.

- **2025-05-07 09:20:00** A script was used to check the OCSP responses of all issued certificates.

- **2025-05-07 11:20:00** Upon inspection, all issued certificates except the two affected certificates had normal OCSP responses. It was initially determined that the issue only affected some certificates.

- **2025-05-07 13:30:00** The Quality Assurance team worked with the Development team to try to reproduce the issue in a test environment.

- **2025-05-08 13:30:00** SHECA discovered a new problematic certificate (https://crt.sh/?opt=ocsp&sha256=6608c555fd0ad961d117c01cfafd3cade70bb47cbdc15378c448408a211f57b1) through ocsp_watch, checked the relevant issuance logs, and preliminarily determined the cause of the problem.

- **2025-05-09 11:42:00** The quality assurance team successfully reproduced the problem after executing test cases several times.

- **May 9, 2025 11:45:00**

Log analysis confirmed the root cause. During the SHECA certificate issuance process, the system follows the following logic (SHECA encapsulates the linting function as an independent service for each component to use):

1. Linting the pre-certificate and then write the certificate data to the database.

2. Submit the certificate to the Certificate Transparency (CT) log service and re-sign it after embedding the CT log information.

3. Lint the re-signed certificate again.

**The problem occurred in step 3:** When linting the signed certificate, the network timeout triggered an exception. Because SHECA uses the Java Spring transaction framework, the network exception caused the entire database transaction to roll back, resulting in the certificate data not being written to the database, and the subsequent OCSP query could not locate the certificate.

N/A

### Root Cause Analysis

**Contributing Factor #: 1**

- **Description:** Due to improper transaction handling in the code, a database transaction was rolled back, resulting in certificate data not being written correctly. This led to abnormal OCSP responses.
- **Timeline:**
  - **2024-07-02:** SHECA replaced its linting tool with pkimetal and updated the logic to run linting on both precertificates and final certificates.
  - **2024-07-15:** Code changes were completed and deployed.
  - **2025-05-07:** This issue was discovered through notification from a third party.
  - **2025-05-12:** Locate the cause of the problem and fix it.
- **Detection:** Reported via third-party email.
- **Interaction with other factors:** N/A
- **Root Cause Analysis methodology used:** The issue was reproduced in a test environment by executing automated certificate issuance test cases.
- **Lessons Learned**: N/A
- **What went well:** N/A
- **What didnâ€™t go well:** The alert mechanism for linting failure is not perfect. When linting fails due to code network anomalies, no alert is triggered.
- **Where we got lucky:** The number of certificates affected by the issue was very small.
- **Additional:** N/A
