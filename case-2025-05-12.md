  Shanghai Electronic Certification Authority Co., Ltd.

- **Incident description:**

  SHECA received an email notifying us that there were problems with the OCSP responses of the following two certificates. After investigation, it was found that the certificate information was not written into the database due to a bug in the code, resulting in abnormal OCSP responses.

### Impact

- **Total number of certificates:** Two certificates were found to be affected by this incident.
- **Total number of "remaining valid" certificates:** Over 23000 certificates remain valid.
- **Affected certificate types:** DV SSL certificates, OV SSL certificates, EV SSL certificates
- **Incident heuristic:** When writing certificate data, attention should be paid to the use of database transactions to prevent abnormal certificate status due to improper transaction management.
- **Was issuance stopped in response to this incident, and why or why not?** Certificate issuance was not stopped because SHECA determined that the probability of a certificate being affected was extremely low (approximately 1 in several thousand). Furthermore, the issue was promptly identified and fixed.
- **Analysis:** N/A
- **Additional considerations:** There was no alert mechanism in place for network exceptions during service invocation.

### Timeline

**All timestamps are in Beijing Time (UTC+8)**

- **2025-05-07 09:09:00** The Compliance Department received a notification that the OCSP responses for two certificates were abnormal.

- **2025-05-07 09:20:00** A script was used to check the OCSP responses of all recently issued certificates.

- **2025-05-07 11:20:00** The check confirmed that, aside from the two affected certificates, all other issued certificates had normal OCSP responses. It was initially determined that the issue affected only a subset of certificates.

- **2025-05-07 13:30:00** The QA team collaborated with the R&D team to reproduce the issue in a test environment.

- **2025-05-09 11:42:00** After executing thousands of test cases, the test engineers successfully reproduced the issue.

- **2025-05-09 11:45:00**

  Log analysis confirmed the root cause. During the certificate issuance process at SHECA, the system follows the logic below:

  - SHECA encapsulates the linting functionality as an independent service for use by various components:
    1. Linting is performed on the precertificate, after which the certificate data is written to the database.
    2. The certificate is submitted to the Certificate Transparency (CT) log service, and re-signed after embedding the CT log information.
    3. Linting is performed again on the re-signed certificate.
  - **The issue occurred in step 3:** During linting of the signed certificate, a network timeout triggered an exception. Since SHECA uses the Java Spring transaction framework, the exception caused the entire database transaction to roll back. As a result, the certificate data was not written to the database, and subsequent OCSP queries could not locate the certificate.

- **2025-05-12 17:30:00** The issue is expected to be resolved by this time. (Due to the strict deployment process and the need for multiple rounds of testing, additional time is required to release the fix.)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Contributing Factor #: 1**

- **Description:** Due to improper transaction handling in the code, a database transaction was rolled back, resulting in certificate data not being written correctly. This led to abnormal OCSP responses.
- **Timeline:**
  - **2024-07-02:** SHECA replaced its linting tool with pkimetal and updated the logic to run linting on both precertificates and final certificates.
  - **2024-07-15:** Code changes were completed and deployed.
  - **2025-05-07:** The issue was reported via third-party email.
  - **2025-05-12:** The issue was fixed.
- **Detection:** Reported via third-party email.
- **Interaction with other factors:** N/A
- **Root Cause Analysis methodology used:** The issue was reproduced in a test environment by executing automated certificate issuance test cases.
- **Lessons Learned**: N/A
- **What went well:** N/A
- **What didnâ€™t go well:** Incomplete alerting for linting failures; no alerts were triggered when linting failed due to code-related exceptions.
- **Where we got lucky:** The number of certificates affected by the issue was very small.
- **Additional:** N/A
