## Incident Report

### Summary

SHECA issued a new intermediate root certificate for a partner and configured a new certificate product. However, when issuing DV SSL certificates under the intermediate root **Keymatic Secure Domain ECC CA G1**, an operator error caused the DV SSL certificate product to mistakenly reference the OV SSL certificate template. Additionally, due to the absence of the product code in the whitelist, the **pre-issuance linting** process was not executed. As a result, the issued certificates contained the OV certificate OID in the **certificatePolicies** extension and included only **CN** and **C** attributes in the certificate's DN.

### Impact

The following three certificates contained formatting errors. All have since been revoked upon the customer's request.

### Timeline

All times are UTC+8.

**2025-01-05:**

- **15:00**: SHECA issued a new custom intermediate root certificate **Keymatic Secure Domain ECC CA G1** for the partner.

**2024-01-24:**

- **21:00**: A new DV SSL certificate product was added. The CA system operator configured the certificate template for the intermediate root (**Keymatic Secure Domain ECC CA G1**) and refreshed the cache to activate the template.

**2024-02-05:**

- **15:00**: A subscriber requested ECC algorithm certificates, and SHECA issued three certificates.

**2024-02-07:**

- **17:21**: SHECA's compliance department received an alert indicating format issues with three DV certificates issued by **Keymatic Secure Domain ECC CA G1**. The alert originated from a **scheduled linting task** that runs every Friday to lint all unrevoked certificates. Detected issues trigger alert notifications.
- **17:30**: The compliance department informed the business team to stop issuing certificates under **Keymatic Secure Domain ECC CA G1**.
- **23:44**: SHECA received a third-party email notification about formatting issues with the certificates. Upon verification, the issues matched those in the previously identified certificates.

**2024-02-10:**

- **10:02**: The CA system operator identified that the DV SSL certificate product associated with **Keymatic Secure Domain ECC CA G1** had been mistakenly configured to reference the OV SSL certificate template.
- **10:10**: The operator reviewed all certificate product configurations and confirmed no other products had similar issues.
- **10:40**: The operator reconfigured the DV SSL certificate product template for **Keymatic Secure Domain ECC CA G1** and refreshed the cache.
- **11:00**: Investigated the reason why **pre-issuance linting** was not executed. SHECA mandates pre-issuance linting for all certificates to verify compliance with BR requirements.
- **15:01**: Identified that **pre-issuance linting** was skipped because the product code for the DV SSL certificate product associated with **Keymatic Secure Domain ECC CA G1** was missing from the linting whitelist.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Cause 1**:  
The CA system operator mistakenly configured the DV SSL certificate product associated with **Keymatic Secure Domain ECC CA G1** to reference the OV SSL certificate template.

**Cause 2**:  
SHECA uses a whitelist to define which certificate products are subject to **pre-issuance linting**. After adding the new product, the engineers were not notified to add the product code to the whitelist, resulting in the failure of the **pre-issuance linting** check to catch this misconfiguration.

### Lessons Learned

#### What went well

- SHECA's scheduled linting task for unrevoked certificates promptly identified the issue.

#### What didn't go well

- The certificate template configuration process lacked a secondary review mechanism.
- The new product addition process was not standardized.

#### Where we got lucky

- Not applicable.

### Action Items

| Action Item                                                  | Kind    | Due Date   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ---------- |
| Standardize the process for adding new products by including the step to add product codes to the linting whitelist. | Prevent | 2025-02-30 |
| Implement a secondary review mechanism for certificate template configurations. Templates configured by an operator must be reviewed and approved by an auditor before activation. | Prevent | 2025-02-30 |
