  - **Timeline summary:**

    - **Non-compliance start date:** 2023-05-30
    - **Non-compliance identified date:** 2025-10-07
    - **Non-compliance end date:** 2025-10-09

  - **Relevant policies:**

    **BR 6.1.1.3:**
    "If the Subscriber Certificate will contain an extKeyUsage extension containing either the values id-kp-serverAuth [RFC5280] or anyExtendedKeyUsage [RFC5280], the CA SHALL NOT generate a Key Pair on behalf of a Subscriber, and SHALL NOT accept a certificate request using a Key Pair previously generated by the CA."

    **BR 9.6.3:**
    "The Applicant is obligated and warrants to take all reasonable measures to ensure control, confidentiality, and proper protection at all times of the private key corresponding to the public key included in the requested Certificate (as well as any related activation data or devices, such as passwords or tokens);"

    **BR 4.9.1.1**
“With the exception of Short-lived Subscriber Certificates, the CA SHOULD revoke a certificate within 24 hours and MUST revoke a Certificate within 5 days and use the corresponding CRLReason (see Section 7.2.2) if one or more of the following occurs: 
16. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Subscriber's Private Key to compromise or if there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed (CRLReason #1, keyCompromise).”

  - ### **Impact**

    - **Total number of certificates:** 18838

    - **Total number of "remaining valid" certificates:** 7177

    - **Affected certificate types:** OV-TLS (OID:2.23.140.1.2.2) and DV-TLS (OID:2.23.140.1.2.1）

    - **Incident heuristic:**  

    - **Was issuance stopped in response to this incident?**

    SHECA has not ceased certificate issuance. SHECA has informed the two invloved partners that all certificates issued before the deactivation of the aforementioned interfaces (by 23:59:59 UTC+8 on October 9, 2025) will be revoked. This is because the private keys of these certificates may all have been transmitted to SHECA's server via the interfaces.

    - **Analysis:** 

      The scope of certificates affected by this incident includes all valid certificates issued through the three interfaces by 23:59:59 UTC+8 on October 9, 2025.

      **Xinnet：**

      All valid certificates issued under the two ICAs (UCA Global G2 Root - Xinnet DV SSL and UCA Global G2 Root - Xinnet OV SSL) by 23:59:59 UTC+8 on October 9, 2025.

    ​**China Mobile Cloud：**

    ​All valid certificates issued under China Mobile Cloud accounts by 23:59:59 UTC+8 on October 9, 2025.

    - **Additional considerations:** 

      Not applicable.

2025-10-02 20:35: SHECA received a message in the MSDP discussion group regarding the online tool it provides to subscribers for generating CSRs and private keys.
2025-10-04 05:42: SHECA obtained an initial response stating that if the relevant functions are implemented using JavaScript on the front-end interface and the CA itself does not access subscribers' private keys, this does not violate BR regulations. The community informed SHECA that there might be some issues with its current implementation code and provided professional rectification suggestions. SHECA has already started rectifying the relevant code, and the progress will be synchronized as a rectification item in this case.
2025-10-06 06:57: SHECA received a notification indicating that the open APIs have accessed private keys, which may violate BR regulations. SHECA immediately launched an internal investigation to con
