## Full Incident Report

### Summary

- **CA Owner CCADB unique ID:** 

  Shanghai Electronic Certification Authority Co., Ltd.

- **Incident description:** 

  During a routine spot check, SHECA's compliance team identified an error in the issuance of a certificate's DN fields: the **stateOrProvinceName** and **localityName** were incorrectly issued. Instead of "重庆市" (Chongqing City), they were mistakenly issued as "重庆币" (Chongqing Coin). Since the Chinese characters "市" (City) and "币" (Coin) are visually similar, The certificate auditors did not find this problem during the initial review and re-review.

  These data are submitted into the system via API by users of downstream agents. However, the audit system lacks validation for this basic information, leading to manual review errors and the issuance of incorrect **stateOrProvinceName** and **localityName** fields。

  ### **Root Cause Analysis**

  **Contributing Factor #1: Lack of system validation for stateOrProvinceName and localityName fields**

  - **Description:** The system lacks automated validation for certificate DN fields, making manual checks prone to errors.
  - **Timeline:** This issue has existed but was not previously identified.
  - **Detection:** Discovered through internal review; future improvements will include automated checks.
  - **Interaction with other factors:** Not applicable.

  **Contributing Factor #2: Inadequate reviewer training on identifying visually similar characters**

  - **Detection:** The issue will be included in future reviewer training to increase awareness.
  - **Interaction with other factors:** Not applicable.
