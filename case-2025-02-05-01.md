### Response Regarding Pre-Issuance Linting Issue

After discussing with the R&D engineers, we believe that enabling **pre-issuance Linting** by default for all certificate products is feasible. At the same time, by configuring directories, we exclude certain non-public trusted certificate products from requiring pre-issuance Linting, ensuring that the issue of products not undergoing pre-issuance Linting is avoided. I have adjusted the action plan accordingly.

### Clarification on SHECA Internal Updates, New Certificate Templates, and New Certificate Product Processes

As mentioned earlier, SHECA has the following sets of templates for subscriber SSL certificates:

- **RSA DV SSL Subscriber Certificate Template**
- **ECDSA DV SSL Subscriber Certificate Template**
- **RSA OV SSL Subscriber Certificate Template**
- **ECDSA OV SSL Subscriber Certificate Template**
- **RSA EV SSL Subscriber Certificate Template**
- **ECDSA EV SSL Subscriber Certificate Template**

**SHECA Update and New Certificate Template Process**

- Stay updated on BR-related updates by subscribing to and following forum polls, etc.;
- Evaluate the impact of BR updates on certificate templates, and the compliance department will provide the latest version of the **certificate template files**, initiating a review by the "Security Certification Committee";
- After approval by the "Security Certification Committee", CA operators will configure the relevant certificate product templates based on the **certificate template files**;
- The compliance department will review the certificate template configuration to ensure correctness based on the **certificate template files**;
- The certificate will be issued, and a pre-issuance check will be conducted to verify if it passes.

**SHECA New Certificate Product Process**

- The business department initiates the new product process with the "Security Certification Committee";
- After approval by the "Security Certification Committee", CA operators will add the new certificate product and associate it with the corresponding certificate product template;
- The certificate will be issued, and pre-issuance linting will be checked to ensure it passes.

The error occurred during step 2 of the new certificate product process, where the CA operator mistakenly configured the DV SSL certificate product with the OV template. To prevent human error, SHECA has added a review step in step 2, requiring compliance review and approval before the product is successfully added.

**Adjusted SHECA New Certificate Product Process**

- The business department submits a new product application to the "Security Certification Committee";
- After approval by the "Security Certification Committee", CA operators will add the new certificate product and associate it with the corresponding certificate product template;
- **The compliance department will review the new productâ€™s configuration for correctness**;
- The certificate will be issued, and pre-issuance linting will be checked to ensure it passes.

| Enable pre-issuance linting by default for all certificate products, excluding non-public trusted certificate products that do not require it. | Prevent | 2025-02-27 |
| A secondary review mechanism is implemented for adding new certificate products. After a new certificate product is added, it must be reviewed and confirmed by the compliance department for the second time before the product can take effect. | Prevent | 2025-02-27 |
