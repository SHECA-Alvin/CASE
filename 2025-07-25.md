## Full Incident Report

There are some errors in the title description. The **stateOrProvinceName** and **localityName** of the certificate are issued incorrectly, and the **streetAddress** field is not involved.

### Summary

- **CA Owner CCADB unique ID:** 

  Shanghai Electronic Certification Authority Co., Ltd.

- **Incident description:** 

  During a routine spot check, SHECA's compliance team identified an error in the issuance of a certificate's DN fields: the **stateOrProvinceName** and **localityName** were incorrectly issued. Instead of "重庆市" (Chongqing City), they were mistakenly issued as "重庆币" (Chongqing Coin). Since the Chinese characters "市" (City) and "币" (Coin) are visually similar, The certificate auditors did not find this problem during the initial review and re-review.

  This data was submitted to the system by users of downstream agents through the API. However, the audit system lacked verification of the basic information in the certificate DN item, and manual audit errors occurred, resulting in the issuance of certificates containing incorrect **stateOrProvinceName** and **localityName** fields.

  ### **Root Cause Analysis**

  **Contributing Factor #1: Lack of system validation for stateOrProvinceName and localityName fields**

  - **Description:** The system lacks automatic verification of basic fields of the certificate DN, such as city, province, etc., and manual inspection is prone to errors.
  - **Timeline:** This issue has existed but was not previously identified.
  - **Detection:** An internal review of Compliance identified this issue; future improvements will include automated checks.
  - **Interaction with other factors:** Not applicable.

  **Contributing Factor #2: Certificate reviewers lack additional review awareness of similar characters**

  - **Description:** in manual checking scenarios, reviewers lack awareness of paying attention to spelling errors (for example, mistakenly writing "重庆市" as "重庆币").
  - **Timeline:** This issue has existed but was not previously identified.
  - **Detection:** This problem was identified in the current incident; in manual checking scenarios, reviewer should be trained to pay attention to spelling errors.
  - **Interaction with other factors:** Not applicable.
