## Full Incident Report

### Summary

- **CA Owner CCADB unique ID:** 

  SHECA（A000261）

- **Incident description:** 

  During a routine spot check, SHECA's compliance team identified an error in the issuance of a certificate's DN fields: the **stateOrProvinceName** and **localityName** were incorrectly issued. Instead of "重庆市" (Chongqing City), they were mistakenly issued as "重庆币" (Chongqing Coin). Since the Chinese characters "市" (City) and "币" (Coin) are visually similar, The certificate auditors did not find this problem during the initial review and re-review.

  The certificate application was submitted to the system by SHECA's certificate agent through the API. The review system did not verify the basic information in the certificate DN item, and an error occurred during the manual review, resulting in the issued certificate containing incorrect **stateOrProvinceName** and **localityName** fields.

- **Timeline summary:**

  - **Non-compliance start date:**   2025-07-21
  - **Non-compliance identified date:**   2025-07-21
  - **Non-compliance end date:**   2025-07-21

- **Relevant policies:**  

  Section 3.2.2.1 of [CA-Browser-Forum TLS BR 2.1.6](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.1.6.pdf)

  #### 3.2.2.1 Identity

  If the Subject Identity Information is to include the name or address of an organization, the CA SHALL verify the identity and address of the organization and that the address is the Applicant's address of existence or operation. The CA SHALL verify the identity and address of the Applicant using documentation provided by, or through communication with, at least one of the following:

  1. A government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicant's legal creation, existence, or recognition;
  2. A third party database that is periodically updated and considered a Reliable Data Source;
  3. A site visit by the CA or a third party who is acting as an agent for the CA; or
  4. An Attestation Letter.

  The CA MAY use the same documentation or communication described in 1 through 4 above to verify both the Applicant's identity and address.

  Alternatively, the CA MAY verify the address of the Applicant (but not the identity of the Applicant) using a utility bill, bank statement, credit card statement, government-issued tax document, or other form of identification that the CA determines to be reliable.

- **Source of incident disclosure:** 

  Self Reported

- ### **Impact**

  - **Total number of certificates:** 1

  - **Total number of "remaining valid" certificates:** 0

  - **Affected certificate types:**  OV-TLS (OID:2.23.140.1.2.2)

  - **Incident heuristic:** SHECA scanned all valid certificates and found that only this certificate had this problem.

  - **Was issuance stopped in response to this incident?** 

    SHECA has stopped issuing OV certificates through **Keymatic Secure Business ECC CA G1** and **xx** root certificates. SHECA needs to understand why the agent passed the wrong value to the interface to confirm that the problem originated from the applicant's incorrect input or a system issue. For this reason, SHECA requested the agent to modify the interface, changing the input box to a selection box to prevent such errors from happening again.

  - **Analysis:** Not applicable.

  - **Additional considerations:** Not applicable.

  ### **Root Cause Analysis**

  **Contributing Factor #1: Lack of system validation for stateOrProvinceName and localityName fields**

  - **Description:** The system lacks automatic verification of basic fields of the certificate DN, such as city, province, etc., and manual inspection is prone to errors.

  - **Timeline:** This issue has existed but was not previously identified.

  - **Detection:** According to SHECA's internal operating rules, compliance personnel conduct weekly spot checks on certificates issued that week. This certificate error was discovered during the spot check by compliance personnel. This situation had not been found in previous inspections and may recur due to the lack of automatic verification.

  - **Interaction with other factors:** 

    The lack of automated verification of basic data will greatly increase the probability of manual review errors.

  - **Root Cause Analysis methodology used**

   **Why do certificates have errors in the stateOrProvinceName and localityName fields?**

  Because the errors weren't caught during manual review.

  **Why did manual review miss the errors?**

  Because manual review relies on human judgment and is prone to errors due to oversight.

  **Why is there no mechanism to compensate for the shortcomings of manual review?**

  Because the system lacks automatic validation for these two fields, preventing errors in advance.

  **Why does the system still lack this automatic validation feature?**

  Because automatic validation of these two basic fields wasn't included in the system design or requirements phase, possibly due to insufficient compliance risk assessment of the certificate DN field.

  **Why wasn't this validation feature considered during the requirements phase?**

  Because it was believed that manual review was sufficient to check these basic fields, and the limitations of manual review were not foreseen, or there was insufficient reference to similar error cases in the industry.

  ### **Lessons Learned**

  - **What went well:** The Compliance Department helped us discover this issue quickly during weekly spot checks.
  - **What didn’t go well:** The system lacks automatic verification of basic fields of the certificate DN, such as city, province, etc.
  - **Where we got lucky:** Not applicable.
  - **Additional:** Not applicable.
