## Full Incident Report

### Summary

- **CA Owner CCADB unique ID:** 

  SHECA（A000261）

- **Incident description:** 

  During a routine spot check, SHECA's compliance team identified an error in the issuance of a certificate's DN fields: the **stateOrProvinceName** and **localityName** were incorrectly issued. Instead of **"重庆市" (Chongqing City)**, they were mistakenly issued as **"重庆币" (Chongqing Coin)**. Since the Chinese characters "市" (City) and "币" (Coin) are visually similar, The certificate auditors did not find this problem during the initial review and re-review.

  This certificate application was submitted to the system by SHECA's SSL certificate reseller via the API. The audit system does not automatically verify the correctness of the geographic information, and manual review failed to identify this issue, resulting in the issued certificate containing incorrect **stateOrProvinceName** and **localityName** information.

- **Timeline summary:**

  - **Non-compliance start date:**   2025-07-21
  - **Non-compliance identified date:**   2025-07-21
  - **Non-compliance end date:**   2025-07-21

- **Relevant policies:**  

  Section 3.2.2.1 of [CA-Browser-Forum TLS BR 2.1.6](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/CA-Browser-Forum-TLS-BR-2.1.6.pdf)

  #### 3.2.2.1 Identity

  If the Subject Identity Information is to include the name or address of an organization, the CA SHALL verify the identity and address of the organization and that the address is the Applicant's address of existence or operation. The CA SHALL verify the identity and address of the Applicant using documentation provided by, or through communication with, at least one of the following:

  1. A government agency in the jurisdiction of the Applicant's legal creation, existence, or recognition;
  2. A third party database that is periodically updated and considered a Reliable Data Source;
  3. A site visit by the CA or a third party who is acting as an agent for the CA; or
  4. An Attestation Letter.

  The CA MAY use the same documentation or communication described in 1 through 4 above to verify both the Applicant's identity and address.

  Alternatively, the CA MAY verify the address of the Applicant (but not the identity of the Applicant) using a utility bill, bank statement, credit card statement, government-issued tax document, or other form of identification that the CA determines to be reliable.

- **Source of incident disclosure:** 

  Self Reported

- ### **Impact**

  - **Total number of certificates:** 1

  - **Total number of "remaining valid" certificates:** 0

  - **Affected certificate types:**  OV-TLS (OID:2.23.140.1.2.2)

  - **Incident heuristic:** SHECA scanned all valid certificates and found that only this certificate had this problem.

  - **Was issuance stopped in response to this incident?** 

    SHECA has stopped issuing certificates for its sub-CAs, **Keymatic Secure Business ECC CA G1** and **Keymatic Secure Business RSA CA G1**. SHECA needs to understand why the certificate reseller passed incorrect values to the CA. After determining that the error was caused by subscriber input errors, SHECA has asked the distributor to modify the certificate application interface, replacing input fields with selection fields to prevent such errors from occurring again.After the reseller's application interface was modified, SHECA reopened the reseller's certificate application.

  - **Analysis:** Not applicable.

  - **Additional considerations:** Not applicable.

  ### **Timeline**

  **All timestamps are Beijing time (UTC+8)**

  - **2025-07-17 21:28**: A client applied for a certificate from SHECA through SHECA's SSL certificate reseller. Using the Wubi input method (Wubi is a Chinese character input method used in mainland China. It breaks down Chinese characters into strokes and components and inputs them using five keyboard areas based on the shape and order of these strokes). The client mistakenly wrote "重庆市" (Chongqing City) as "重庆币" (Chongqing Coin).
  - **2025-07-18 14:11**: SHECA reviewed the certificate application according to standard procedures.
  - **2025-07-18 14:54**: Neither the initial reviewer nor the re-reviewer discovered the "重庆币" error, and the certificate was issued.
  - **2025-07-18 17:27**: The compliance department discovered this issue during weekly spot checks. **2025-07-18 18:09**: After quick communication with the customer, the certificate has been revoked.
    **2025-07-23 17:30**: A full certificate scan script has completed and no certificates with similar issues have been found.

  | [1648997](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1648997) | 2020-06-28 | It is true that the geographic information submitted by subscribers was automatically verified, resulting in incorrect stateOrProvince and localityName information being checked into the certificate. |
  | [1715024](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715024) | 2021-06-07 | Because the stateOrProvince and localityName fields are not automatically validated, misspelled information is written into the certificate DN item. |
  | [1710243](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1710243) | 2021-05-08 | Due to inaccurate data sources, stateOrProvince and localityName verification failed, and incorrect information was checked into the DN item of the certificate. |

  ### **Root Cause Analysis**

  **Contributing Factor #1: Lack of automated verification of geographic information**

  - **Description:** The system lacks automatic verification of basic fields of the certificate DN, such as city, province, etc., and manual inspection is prone to errors.

  - **Timeline:** This issue has existed but was not previously identified.

  - **Detection:** SHECA compliance personnel conducted spot checks on certificates issued this week and discovered errors during this process. Because SHECA's certificate review system doesn't support automatic geographic information checking, and such errors are difficult to detect through manual review, SHECA was previously unaware of this issue. SHECA will subsequently integrate with ISO 3166-2 data sources to automatically compare submitted geographic information, helping reviewers identify such errors.

  - **Interaction with other factors:** 

    The lack of automated verification of basic data will greatly increase the probability of manual review errors.

  - **Root Cause Analysis methodology used**

    SHECA uses "5-Whys" to analyze the above problems:

     **Why do certificates have errors in the stateOrProvinceName and localityName fields?**

    Because the errors weren't caught during manual review.

    **Why did manual review miss the errors?**

    Because manual review relies on human judgment and is prone to errors due to oversight.

    **Why is there no mechanism to compensate for the shortcomings of manual review?**

    Because the system lacks automatic validation for these two fields, preventing errors in advance.

    **Why does the system still lack this automatic validation feature?**

    Because automatic validation of these two basic fields wasn't included in the system design or requirements phase, possibly due to insufficient compliance risk assessment of the certificate DN field.

    **Why wasn't this validation feature considered during the requirements phase?**

    Because it was believed that manual review was sufficient to check these basic fields, and the limitations of manual review were not foreseen, or there was insufficient reference to similar error cases in the industry.

  ### **Lessons Learned**

  - **What went well:** The Compliance Department helped us discover this issue quickly during weekly spot checks.
  - **What didn’t go well:** The system lacks automatic verification of basic fields of the certificate DN, such as city, province, etc.
  - **Where we got lucky:** Not applicable.
  - **Additional:** Not applicable.
