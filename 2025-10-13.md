### Summary

- **CA Owner CCADB unique ID:**

  SHECA（A000261）

- **Incident description:**

  According to SHECA's description, SHECA needed to revoke the certificates affected by this case before 2025-10-13 20:36. However, due to some reasons, the revocation of all certificates has not been completed. SHECA applied for an extension of the revocation, which is scheduled to be postponed to 2025-10-21 23:59:59 And SHECA will synchronize the revocation progress every day.

- **Timeline summary:**

  - **Non-compliance start date:** 2025-10-13 20:35
  - **Non-compliance identified date:** 2025-10-13 20:35
  - **Non-compliance end date:** 2025-10-21 23:59:59

- **Relevant policies:**

  **BR 4.9.1.1**

  With the exception of Short-lived Subscriber Certificates, the CA SHOULD revoke a certificate within 24 hours and MUST revoke a Certificate within 5 days and use the corresponding CRLReason (see Section 7.2.2) if one or more of the following occurs:

  1. The Certificate no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/blob/main/docs/BR.md#615-key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/blob/main/docs/BR.md#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking) (CRLReason #4, superseded);
  2. The CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);
  3. The CA is made aware that a Subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);
  4. The CA is made aware of any circumstance indicating that use of a Fully-Qualified Domain Name or IP address in the Certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or arbitrator has revoked a Domain Name Registrant's right to use the Domain Name, a relevant licensing or services agreement between the Domain Name Registrant and the Applicant has terminated, or the Domain Name Registrant has failed to renew the Domain Name) (CRLReason #5, cessationOfOperation);
  5. The CA is made aware that a Wildcard Certificate has been used to authenticate a fraudulently misleading subordinate Fully-Qualified Domain Name (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);
  6. The CA is made aware of a material change in the information contained in the Certificate (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);
  7. The CA is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with these Requirements or the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement (CRLReason #4, superseded);
  8. The CA determines or is made aware that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);
  9. The CA's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository (CRLReason "unspecified (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL);
  10. Revocation is required by the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement for a reason that is not otherwise required to be specified by this section 4.9.1.1 (CRLReason "unspecified (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL); or
  11. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Subscriber's Private Key to compromise or if there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed (CRLReason #1, keyCompromise).

- ### **Impact**

  **Total number of certificates:** 6920

  **Total number of "remaining valid" certificates:**  1250

  **Affected certificate types:** OV-TLS (OID:2.23.140.1.2.2) and DV-TLS (OID:2.23.140.1.2.1）

  **Incident heuristic:**  

  **Was issuance stopped in response to this incident?**

  SHECA has not stopped issuing certificates. SHECA will revoke all certificates issued before 2025-10-09 23:59:59 that violate BR regulations. All APIs involved in violations after 2025-10-09 23:59:59 have been taken offline. Subsequent newly applied certificates are subject to this case.

  **Analysis:** 

  This revocation process strictly adheres to the requirements outlined in SHECA'sf [**MRIP&TP**](https://assets-cdn.sheca.com/documents/Mass%20Revocation%20Incident%20Preparation%20and%20Testing%20Plan%20v1.1.pdf) (Mass Revocation Incident Preparation and Testing Plan).

  The following is SHECA's certificate revocation plan for the relevant certificates. This certificate revocation and reissue process uses a methodology similar to ACME ARI (Automated Certificate Management Environment Automatic Update Infrastructure). When developing SHECA's [**MRIP&TP**](https://assets-cdn.sheca.com/documents/Mass%20Revocation%20Incident%20Preparation%20and%20Testing%20Plan%20v1.1.pdf), SHECA required all partners connecting to its API to implement a scheduled script to query all order information daily and initiate reissue tasks for orders marked "pending revocation" SHECA will notify partners in advance of these orders:

  - SHECA requires its partners to send certificate revocation notifications to all subscribers through various means.

  - SHECA will mark all orders associated with certificates pending revocation as "pending revocation" in its certificate management system.

  - SHECA and its partners will conduct a comprehensive scan of all orders and initiate reissue requests for orders marked "revoked."

  - Partners submit re-issuance applications in batches; after the certificate is successfully issued, subscribers will be notified of the replacement certificate within 24 hours

  Per the above plan, SHECA was initially able to complete the revocation of all certificates within 5 days. However, the process did not meet the expected timeline due to the following circumstances, necessitating an extension of the revocation period:

  **1.Network Freeze at China Mobile Cloud (a SHECA Partner)**

  As of **October 12, 2025**, China Mobile Cloud — a major telecommunications service provider in China that offers fundamental telecom services — has implemented a **Network Freeze** to support a large-scale event. During this period, all internal services are prohibited from being updated. Since the script code for certificate re-issuance at China Mobile Cloud requires service updates to function, immediate execution is not feasible. Additionally, mandatory certificate revocation could pose significant risks to critical communication infrastructure supported by China Mobile Cloud.

  ***Definition of Network Freeze***: A period where non-essential configuration changes, version upgrades, and hardware adjustments to network devices and systems are suspended. Only fault repairs are permitted, all to ensure network stability.

  **2.Some subscribers have not yet adopted automated certificate issuance solutions.**
  Currently, a considerable number of subscribers have not yet adopted automated certificate issuance solutions. For these subscribers, domain name verification and certificate renewal still rely on manual processes, which are time-consuming. Following this incident, SHECA will notify the relevant customers to switch to automated solutions as soon as possible and reiterate that the CA reserves the right to revoke certificates within a specified timeframe.

  In conclusion, SHECA hereby applies to the community for an extension of the certificate revocation deadline, which is requested to be adjusted to **23:59:59 on October 21, 2025**.

  **3.Holiday Reason**

  As both October 8 and October 12, 2025, fall on public holidays in China, there was some delay in the response efficiency of both SHECA and our customers. That said, SHECA is fully aware that this cannot be considered the core cause of this incident. We only wish to provide this context to the community for full transparency.

  **Additional considerations:** 

  Not applicable.

  ### **Root Cause Analysis**

  **Contributing Factor #1: Failure to promptly track the completion progress of partners' large-scale revocation of support capabilities.**

  - **Description:** 

    Due to **Network Freeze**, the code update initiated by Mobile Cloud for re-signing could not be released in a timely manner, resulting in only some certificates being re-signed by subscribers, and a large number of replacement certificates still not being issued.

  - **Timeline:** 

    **2025-08-09** SHECA released the first version of SHECA's [**MRIP&TP**](https://assets-cdn.sheca.com/documents/Mass%20Revocation%20Incident%20Preparation%20and%20Testing%20Plan%20v1.1.pdf)(Mass Revocation Incident Preparation and Testing Plan) in accordance with Mozilla's requirements. Partners connected through the API are required to implement an automated script for mass re-issuance of certificates (as described in the implementation solution above) in accordance with SHECA's requirements. This script is to be run at least once a day.

    **2025-10-09** SHECA notified China Mobile Cloud to run the script, but was informed that China Mobile Cloud had not yet scheduled the relevant feature implementation.

    **2025-10-10** China Mobile Cloud urgently implemented the relevant feature, but due to the **Network Freeze** issue described above, the code update could not be released.

  - **Detection:** 

    Not applicable.

  - **Interaction with other factors:**

    Not applicable.

  - **Root Cause Analysis methodology used**

    SHECA uses "5-Whys" to analyze the above problems:

    **Why 1: Why couldn't the certificate be revoked promptly? **

    Because the new replacement certificate had not yet been fully re-signed.

    **Why 2: Why couldn't the replacement certificate be re-signed quickly? **

    Because China Mobile Cloud had not implemented the automated script for mass re-signing as required by SHECA.

    **Why 3: Why couldn't the script be released? **
    Because China Mobile Cloud was in "Network Freeze" mode, restricting code updates and configuration changes, the developed script could not be released immediately.

    **Why 4: Why did China Mobile Cloud urgently develop the script on October 10th instead of completing it earlier? **
    Because SHECA only notified China Mobile Cloud on October 9th to run the script, China Mobile Cloud discovered that the script function had not yet been scheduled for implementation. Therefore, it had to urgently initiate development to meet the request.
    **Why 5: Why didn't China Mobile Cloud schedule the script function before SHECA's notification on October 9th? **
    SHECA released SHECA's  [**MRIP&TP**](https://assets-cdn.sheca.com/documents/Mass%20Revocation%20Incident%20Preparation%20and%20Testing%20Plan%20v1.1.pdf)on August 9th and clarified the relevant script development requirements to partners. However, SHECA did not follow up on Mobile Cloud's script development progress and failed to promptly identify the "unscheduled" issue with Mobile Cloud. SHECA will subsequently conduct SHECA's  [**MRIP&TP**](https://assets-cdn.sheca.com/documents/Mass%20Revocation%20Incident%20Preparation%20and%20Testing%20Plan%20v1.1.pdf)esting on each API partner.

  **Contributing Factor #2: Some subscribers do not use automated solutions and are unable to quickly complete certificate application and replacement.**

  - **Description:** 

    There are still some users who have not switched to the automated solution, and all operations rely on manual labor, such as manual DNS configuration and manual certificate replacement.

  - **Timeline:** This issue has existed but was not previously identified.

  - **Detection:** 

    Not applicable.

  - **Interaction with other factors:**

    Not applicable.

  - **Root Cause Analysis using "5-Whys" Methodology:**

    1. **Why did SHECA fail to revoke the certificates for case   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1993357  within 5 days?**

       Some certificates have not been reissued.

    2. **Why couldn’t the certificates be revoked promptly?**

       Users need to re-verify domain name ownership.

    3. **Why couldn’t the replacement certificates be re-signed quickly?**

       Users needed extra time for domain validation and certificate replacement.

    4. **Why do users still need to manually configure validation values?**

       They haven’t implemented automated solutions.

    5. **Why haven’t many users adopted automated solutions?**

       Feedback from some users indicates the following reasons:

       - ACME client scripts don’t support automation with certain small DNS providers, and users needing wildcard certificates cannot use file validation without modification.
       - Some certificates are deployed on CDN or WAF services, which don’t support ACME clients.
       - Users have concerns about the reliability of automation.

  ### **Lessons Learned**

  - **What went well:** 

    This revocation was carried out in accordance with SHECA's [**MRIP&TP**](https://assets-cdn.sheca.com/documents/Mass%20Revocation%20Incident%20Preparation%20and%20Testing%20Plan%20v1.1.pdf), and the overall execution was relatively smooth.

  - **What didn’t go well:**

    There are still some customers who do not use automation, and the certificate replacement speed is relatively slow.

  - **Where we got lucky:** Not applicable.

  - **Additional:** Not applicable.
